This script generates a simple HTML visualization of a color palette extracted
from an image on your local system. It uses the RMagick library to determine
which colors occur in the image, then uses sperical K-means clustering to de-dupe
similar colors in the resulting palette.

Usage: colortoy.rb <image file imagemagick can read> [<number of colors>]
